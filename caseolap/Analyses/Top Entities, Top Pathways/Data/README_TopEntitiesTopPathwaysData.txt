The data files produced by the files in the parent directory. 


1) Popularity_Ranked_Entities.csv
The entities (i.e. proteins) ranked based on popularity (i.e. frequency of occurrence in the text dataset). 


2) Popularity_Ranked_Entity_Counts.csv
The counts for the entities (i.e. proteins) ranked based on popularity (i.e. frequency of occurrence in the text dataset). This can be viewed together with (1) to see how common which entities were.  



3) Popularity_Ranked_Pathway_Counts_in_Each_Category.csv
The counts for the pathways ranked based on popularity (i.e. frequency of participating proteins' occurrence in the text dataset). This can be viewed together with (4) to see how common which entities were.  



4) Popularity_Ranked_Pathways_in_Each_Category.csv
The pathways ranked based on popularity (i.e. frequency of occurrence in the text dataset). Entities (i.e. proteins) were submitted to Reactome pathways database and were then mapped to pathways. Thus, the pathway popularity corresponds to the protein popularity. 



5) top10_entities.csv
The top 10 entities in each category based on CaseOLAP score.


6) top10_scores.csv
The top 10 entities in each category based on CaseOLAP scores.


7) top_entities.csv
The top entities in each category based on CaseOLAP score. 


8) top_scores.csv
The CaseOLAP scores for the top entities from (7) in each category.
