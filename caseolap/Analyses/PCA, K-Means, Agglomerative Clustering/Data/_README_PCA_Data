This is the output for the PCA.


Both, Primary, and Secondary:
-'Both' files correspond to the results from the analyses on both classes of diseases: Primary and Secondary Mitochondrial Diseases
-'Primary' files correspond to the results from the analyses on 'Primary Mitochondrial Diseases' (i.e. diseases directly caused by the mitochondria, namely mutations in mitochondrial DNA)
-'Secondary' files correspond to the results from the analyses on 'Secondary Mitochondrial Diseases' (i.e. diseases not directly caused by the mitochondria, namely, not mutations in mitochondrial DNA)


PCA:
- 'Biplot' files are PCAs
- 'Labeled Biplot' files are PCAs with individual points labeled with their UniProt protein ID. This is useful for inspecting outlier points/proteins.
-'Weights' files show the detailed breakdown of each dimension from the PCA, namely the weights. 


Clustering on PCA:
-'K-Means-on-PCA-Vector-Heads' is the results from running K-means on the end points of the 19 disease vectors from the PCA. 
-'Agglomerative-Clustering-on-PCA-Vector-Heads' is the results from running Agglomerative Clustering on the end points of the 19 disease vectors from the PCA.
