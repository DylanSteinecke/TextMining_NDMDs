
1) cluster-bar.pdf
This is a barplot of all the proteins with their IDs (Y-axis) and their CaseOLAP scores in stacked bars (X-axis) corresponding to different color-coded diseases indicated in the legend. However, some colors correspond to two diseases. The protein-cluster-spreadsheet (10) is better for inspecting each protein's scores for each disease category, but the Protein Cluster Spreadsheet of CaseOLAP Scores.xlsx (11) is best.


2) cluster-bar.png
Same as (1) but png.


3) cluster.pdf
The hierarchical clustering with the proteins on the axes and the color corresponding to how close the points were in the 19-dimensional space. 


4) cluster.png
Same as (3) but png. 


5) cutoff-0.03-cluster-bar.pdf
A sample version of the same as (2) but for when the cutoff value in the cutoff file (see ReadMe in parent folder) is set to 0.03. This can be changed and will create a new file with a new name if the cutoff value is different.


6) cutoff-0.03-cluster-bar.png
Same as (5) but png.


7) cutoff-0.03-cluster.pdf
A sample version of the same as (4) but for when the cutoff value in the cutoff file (see ReadMe in parent folder) is set to 0.03. This can be changed and will create a new file with a new name if the cutoff value is different.


8) cutoff-0.03-cluster.png
Same as (7) but png.


9) heatmap-cutoff-solid.pdf
Similar to (11) which modifies (10) and is similar to (1). This heatmap shows a color intensity corresponding to CaseOLAP score for each protein in each disease category.


10) protein-cluster-spreadsheet.csv
A spreadsheet version of (1). 


11) Protein Cluster Spreadsheet of CaseOLAP Scores.xlsx
A color-coded version of (10). Must be downloaded and viewed in Excel or Google Sheets. This was produced by conditionally formatting the cells in each column, corresponding color intensity to cell value. This was done in Google Sheets but can also be done in a program like Excel.
