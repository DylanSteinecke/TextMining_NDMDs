1) Common Synonyms in Clusters.ipynb
This contains code for identifying the synonyms shared among proteins in the protein clusters. 

2) GraphBuilder-Neo4j-Mito.ipynb
This contains code for visualizing protein-pathway relationships in Python tables and a Neo4j knowledge graph as well as visualizing protein-protein relationships in Neo4j. This code is set up for the 6 selected protein clusters, but it can be modified to work on other clusters or groups of proteins.

3) Making_interactor-nodes.csv.ipynb
This produces the protein-protein relationships for the Neo4j graph. 

4) Making_protein-nodes-csv.ipynb
This produces the protein nodes information for the Neo4j graph.

5) Making_pw2proteinscsv.ipynb
This produces the protein-pathway relationships for the Neo4j graph.

6) data
This stores the data for 4), 5), and 6).
